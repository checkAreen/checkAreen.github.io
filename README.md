Simple ToDo list builded by HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Build it by maximum DOM manipulation.
Also, i've added functions to add, remove and edit elements in localStorage to have an access to the active tasks after refreshing webpage and created liveSearch to sort all tasks.
WITHOUT RESPONSIVE DESIGN AND HAVE A LITTLE PORBLEMS IN CHROME :(
But excellent works in Opera and Firefox.
You can add new tasks, change their status to "Pending", "In-Progress" and "Completed". You can choose 3 types of ETA: "Minor", "Normal" and "ASAP".
Type the title and description and task will be created.
Please, notice that the title of the page tracks the amount of Active tasks.
Also, you can delete tasks from both blocks.
