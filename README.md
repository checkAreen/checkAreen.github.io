Simple ToDo list builded by HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Build it by maximum DOM manipulation.
Also, i've added functions to add, remove and edit elements in localStorage to have an access to the active tasks after refreshing webpage and created liveSearch to sort all tasks.
Without Responsive Design!
